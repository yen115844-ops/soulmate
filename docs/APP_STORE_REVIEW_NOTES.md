## Notes for Reviewer (paste into "Notes" field)

**App name:** [Your app name]

**Payment & wallet – Guideline 3.1**

This app enables users to book **real-world services** (in-person sessions with partners, e.g. tutoring, coaching, consultations). Payments are for these **physical / real-world services consumed outside the app**, not for digital goods or in-app content.

- **Guideline 3.1.3(e) – Goods and Services Outside of the App:** We use payment methods other than in-app purchase (e.g. card, bank transfer, third-party payment gateways) to collect payments for these real-world services. In-app purchase is not used for booking payments.
- **Wallet / balance:** The in-app “wallet” (balance) is used **only** to pay for **bookings** on our platform. Users can top up (deposit) and withdraw funds. The balance is not a general-purpose e-wallet, not used for investing or financial trading, and does not unlock digital content or features.
- **Escrow:** When a user pays for a booking, funds are held temporarily (escrow) until the service is completed. After completion, funds are released to the service provider (partner). This is the same model as marketplace apps (e.g. Grab, Uber, Airbnb) that hold payment until the real-world service is delivered.

**Guideline 3.2.1(viii) – Money management**

This app is not a financial-institution or money-management product. The wallet and escrow are **only** for facilitating payment for **real-world booking services** on our platform. We do not offer financial trading, investing, or standalone money-management services.

**Similar apps on the App Store**

- **GoESCROW** – escrow for buyer/seller transactions.
- **Grab, Uber, Airbnb** – in-app balance and held payments for real-world services.

**Demo / test account**

[Provide a test account and password, and any test card or instructions so the reviewer can try: (1) viewing wallet balance, (2) topping up, (3) making a booking paid with wallet, (4) withdrawal flow if applicable).]

**Licensing (if applicable)**

[If you have an intermediary payment / e-wallet license in Vietnam or another jurisdiction, state it here and attach or link the document in App Review attachment/URL.]

## Metadata checklist (do not imply “universal wallet” or “investment”)

- **App description:** Describe the app as a **booking / marketplace for real-world services**. Mention wallet only as “pay for bookings” or “balance for bookings,” not as a general-purpose wallet or investment tool.
- **Screenshots / previews:** Do not use text like “ví đa năng,” “đầu tư,” or “universal wallet” in screenshots or marketing.
- **In-app copy:** Wallet screens should clearly state that the balance is for paying for bookings on the platform (e.g. “Số dư dùng để thanh toán đặt lịch” / “Balance for booking payments”).
